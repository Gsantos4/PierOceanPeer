# Jetson Nano (B01) Developer Kit Setup

1. Follow NVIDIA's guide: [Get Started Jetson Nano devkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)
2. Short the J48 pins (Connect the two pins together by placing a jumper over them). This allows for the Jetson to be powered from the DC barrel jack. This configuration allows for greater and more stable current draw from the Nano.
