## Introduction
How can we turn the Cal Poly Pier, a staggering half-mile long structure stretching out into Avila Bay, into a home for student-led ocean exploration? This is the question that Thom Maughan of MBARI asked himself when he first heard about the Pier. Extending far into the ocean, the pier offers a platform from which to study all types of ocean organisms and phenomenon and since it's acquisition in 1984 Cal Poly has led a myriad of [research projects](http://www.marine.calpoly.edu/cal-poly-pier). Fast forward a few years and a student team, mentored by Thom, and Bridgette Benson of Cal Poly, was put together to tackle this challenge. The result, **the Pier Ocean Peer**. A Jetson-Nano-based hub for information gathering.
